// Libraries used: AccelStepper library for controlling stepper motors.
// Project description: This code is designed to control a stepper motor at a sidereal rate, which is approximately 1.1605e-5 revolutions per second.
// The motor is geared down by a factor of 10, and the code calculates the necessary steps per second to achieve this rate.
// The stepper motor is controlled using the AccelStepper library, which allows for smooth acceleration and deceleration.
// The code sets up the motor to run at a constant speed corresponding to the sidereal rate.
// The motor is connected to pins 2 and 3 of the Arduino board, which are used for direction and step control respectively.
// The code runs in a loop, continuously moving the motor at the calculated sidereal rate.
// The motor is expected to rotate at a rate that matches the sidereal day, which is approximately 86164.091 seconds.
// This code is suitable for applications such as astronomical tracking, where precise movement of the motor is required to follow celestial objects.
// The code is structured to be efficient and straightforward, focusing on the essential functionality needed for sidereal tracking.


// Include config file for pin assignments and other configurations
#include <config.h>
// Include the AccelStepper library for controlling stepper motors
#include <AccelStepper.h>
